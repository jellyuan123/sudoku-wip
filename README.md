# Sudoku Solver

A web-based Sudoku Solver that connects a Python backend with a React frontend.

## Overview

This project aims to provide a smooth, interactive experience for solving Sudoku puzzles. The frontend is built with React and allows users to input puzzles and view solutions. The backend implements a Python-based Sudoku solving algorithm and is being integrated using Django.

## Project Structure

- **Frontend**: Built with React. Handles user interaction, puzzle input, and result display.
- **Backend**: Written in Python. Solves Sudoku puzzles and serves results via API (in progress).
- **Integration**: Currently working on connecting the Django backend to the React frontend.

## Current Status

- React frontend: mostly complete
- Django backend: initial setup complete, working on API integration
- Sudoku solving logic: implemented in Python and being adapted for Django

## Upcoming Features

- Full API integration between frontend and backend
- Input validation and error handling
- Puzzle generation and difficulty levels
- Improved UI/UX and mobile responsiveness

## Notes

This project is a work in progress, especially the backend integration.
